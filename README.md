## What is the difference between Python and Java Edition?
Python Edition tends to be slower or not compatible with some devices, but you can run or build very easy.

Java edition is very fast, and extremely compatible with any kind of device, but running the app may be tedious for some users.

## Downloading
You can download SecurityHelpy in [**releases**](https://github.com/triplean/sh_java/releases)

## Prerequisites
You need JRE (Java Runtime Environment) 22.0.1 or newer.

## Running
There is two different methods for running:
